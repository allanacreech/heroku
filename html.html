				I want to live in a world with innovative website design, books that come with their own mini-bottle of champagne, and my keyboard to have its own force field to repel error filled coding and sticky kids fingers.
				</p>
				<p id= "para2"> Jumping out of bed with a big smile on my face each morning is what I do, because I love helping my clients blow the roof off their goals. Having personal clients from the dental, healthcare, child development, and sports arenas has allowed me to reach across multiple platforms.
				</p>
				<p>When I'm not coding or creating website material you can find me barefoot on the beach running after two ice-cream enthusiastic kids. So with a shot of skill (and a strong Starbucks coffee) take a look around!
